## Introduction

**book-recommender** is a project designed to recommend books by analyzing their metadata, reviews, and descriptions. It uses semantic search (vector similarity) to find books similar to the ones a user likes. The project includes Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling, and a Gradio dashboard for user interaction.

---

## Features

- **Data Exploration** â€“ Jupyter notebook to explore and visualize the dataset.
- **Sentiment Analysis** â€“ Analyze user reviews or book descriptions.
- **Text Classification** â€“ Categorize books by genre or other attributes.
- **Vector Search** â€“ Recommend similar books using embeddings.
- **Interactive UI** â€“ User-friendly Gradio dashboard for making recommendations.

## Future Improvements

I'm still going with this small project. I will extend this project to a more complete product. I will later post this in the near future
